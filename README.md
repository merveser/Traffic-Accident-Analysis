##  Key Analyses

- **Urban vs Rural**: How accident frequency and severity differ across regions  
- **Vehicle Involvement**: Distribution of vehicles per accident  
- **Weekly Trends**: Accidents by day of the week  
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Predicting future accident rates using ARIMA

## 📁 Dataset
