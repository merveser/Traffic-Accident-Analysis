Traffic Accident Analysis: UK Traffic Accidents Data (2005-2014)
Introduction

This analysis examines UK traffic accident data from 2005-2014 to identify patterns, risk factors, and trends that can inform evidence-based road safety policies. Using data science techniques and machine learning, this study addresses key questions:

When and where do accidents most frequently occur? What environmental factors increase accident risk? How do urban and rural patterns differ? Can we predict future accident trends?

Methodology The analysis combines three datasets spanning 2005-2014, employing:

Temporal Analysis: Hour, day, and seasonal patterns Environmental Assessment: Weather, lighting, and road conditions Geographic Comparison: Urban vs. rural accident characteristics Predictive Modeling: Random Forest algorithm for trend forecasting

This multi-dimensional approach transforms raw accident data into actionable insights for improved road safety planning and policy development
